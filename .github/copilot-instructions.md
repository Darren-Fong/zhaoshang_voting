This project is a Next.js app for a photo voting website. Users can upload up to 3 JPG photos (max 10MB each), and vote on photos (5 votes per user). Use Firebase for authentication (with admin-created usernames), storage (for photos), and Firestore (for votes and photo metadata). Include an upload page, a voting page (photos shown by number, not username), and a config for admin to add usernames. Prepare for Vercel deployment.
